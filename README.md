SCM stands for Software Configuration Management. This is the process of tracking and controlling changes in software. This helps with many things like saving versions of software, making it easier to work with other people in software, and making it easier to update a software. GitHub is amazing for this because it has many tools for collaboration like merging and pulling requests, makes it easy to see changes made from each individual, makes it easy to review changes, and makes it easier to maintain a project over its whole lifecycle.
